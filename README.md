# Spark-recommender

Exercise from the XSEDE Big Data and Machine Learning Workshop. We built a recommendation system using the `pyspark.mllib.ALS` package.

In the python shell, load pyspark using the commend `module load spark`. Then, the file can be run using the `spark -submit spark_recommender.py` commend.
